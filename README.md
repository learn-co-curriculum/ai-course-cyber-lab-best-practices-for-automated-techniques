<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>In the previous lessons, you have learned about automated techniques used in prompt engineering. You had an opportunity to learn about the OpenAI API and how it can be used with Python to enhance the capabilities of LLMs like Chat-GPT through automation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, we identified the benefits and limitations of automated prompt engineering and discussed best practices for using automated techniques in developing efficient, effective, and quality-controlled prompt solutions.</p>
<p>In this exercise, you will be guided to identify your own workflow for an automated prompt solution. By building on the skills you have learned through the duration of this course, you can use this workflow plan as a launching point to begin utilizing the skills from this course right away.</p>
<h4>Lab Objectives</h4>
<p>By the end of this lab you will be able to&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify best practices for using automated techniques in developing efficient, effective, and quality-controlled prompt solutions</li>
</ul>

<h3>Procedure</h3>
<p>Work through Part 1 - Part 3 to develop your own automated workflow. In each section, you will be asked to make decisions based on a specific use case related to your work. This is where you will have an opportunity to combine your domain knowledge with the new skills you have acquired as a budding prompt engineer and use discernment to make the choice that is best for your project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember, prompt solutions are an enhancement of existing skills, and not a replacement! The quality and success of your project is dependent on your expertise in your field as it is on your expertise as a prompt engineer.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Part 1 - Select a Workflow</h3>
<p>Recall that when we discussed prompt engineering workflows, we introduced two popular processes called <strong>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback</strong> and <strong>Rule-Based Prompting</strong>.</p>
<h4><strong>Question 1: </strong>Which workflow would you choose for a specific use case in your work?</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Select the Workflow 1 and Workflow 2 buttons for a refresher on each workflow.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback </strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>Reinforcement learning is a machine learning technique where an agent learns how to make decisions through trial and error.</li>
<li>In the context of human feedback, reinforcement learning involves training an AI model by providing it with examples of correct behavior and evaluating its performance based on the feedback received.</li>
<li>The AI model learns to improve its actions based on the positive or negative signals it receives from human evaluators.</li>
<li>This iterative process helps the model gradually refine its decision-making capabilities, allowing it to make better choices over time.</li>
<li>Reinforcement learning from human feedback is particularly useful when there is a need to teach an AI system specific behaviors or optimize its performance in a specific task.</li>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>Rule-Based Prompting</strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>Rule-based prompting is a technique used in natural language processing to guide the behavior of AI models by providing them with explicit rules or instructions.</li>
<li>These rules define how the model should interpret and respond to different inputs.</li>
<li>By setting up predefined rules, developers can control the output generated by the model, ensuring it aligns with the desired behavior or objective.</li>
<li>Rule-based prompting is often employed in scenarios where specific responses or actions are required, such as in chatbots or virtual assistants.</li>
<li>It allows developers to customize and fine-tune the behavior of the AI model by defining rules that dictate how it should interpret and generate responses based on different inputs.</li>
<li>This approach provides more control over the model's output and can help ensure that it adheres to specific guidelines or requirements.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Part 3 - Develop Your Prompt Strategy</h3>
<h4><strong>Question 3:</strong> How can you structure your prompt to effectively automate a task? Create a set of prompts for your use case.&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Here are two examples to get you started. Use these to think of how you might apply these in your own field. Use your domain knowledge to assess the feasibility of automating your task.</p>
<p>Select each box to reveal details for the examples.</p>
<details style="margin-bottom: 2.5rem;">
<summary style="display: inline-block; background: #394a58; border: 1px solid #8A8B99; padding: 0.5rem 0.75rem; cursor: pointer;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">Example: Culinary Menu</span></summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prompt 1:</strong> Provide me with a list of ingredients that are readily available in Autumn in the North East United States.
<ul>
<li><strong>Expected Output: </strong>List of Ingredients</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Prompt 2: </strong>"Provide me with recipes for pasta dishes using this selection of these ingredients "
<ul>
<li><strong>Expected Output: </strong>List of Recipes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</details><details style="margin-bottom: 2.5rem;">
<summary style="display: inline-block; background: #394a58; border: 1px solid #8A8B99; padding: 0.5rem 0.75rem; cursor: pointer;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">Example: Travel &amp; Tourism Itinerary</span></summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prompt 1: </strong>Provide me a list European destinations
<ul>
<li><strong>Expected Output: </strong>List of Destinations</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Prompt 2:</strong> "Create a personalized travel itinerary for each destination in &nbsp;&lt;List of Destinations&gt; that includes recommendations for attractions, accommodations, and local cuisine. Excluded locations with &lt;your exclusion criteria&gt;"
<ul>
<li><strong>Expected Output: </strong>Personalized Travel Itinerary</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</details>
<p>Remember that when it comes to writing prompts that can be generalized over many different topics, it's important to strike a balance between specificity and flexibility. One approach is to provide a broad initial prompt that captures the overall objective, followed by more specific instructions for generating responses related to each topic of interest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Select the box to reveal details for the example.</p>
<details style="margin-bottom: 2.5rem;">
<summary style="display: inline-block; background: #394a58; border: 1px solid #8A8B99; padding: 0.5rem 0.75rem; cursor: pointer;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">Example: Building a Glossary</span></summary>
<p><strong>1. For example, let's say you want to use prompt engineering with the OpenAI API to automate the creation of a glossary for computational linguistics. You could start with a prompt like:</strong></p>
<blockquote style="padding-left: 40px;">Provide me with every vocabulary term for computational linguistics</blockquote>
<p>This initial prompt sets the overarching goal of generating a comprehensive list of terms related to the field.</p>
<p><strong>2. To instruct the model to provide definitions for each word in the generated list, you can follow up with a prompt like,</strong></p>
<blockquote style="padding-left: 40px;">For each word X in the list, Provide me with the definition of X in the context of computational linguistics.</blockquote>
<p>This instruction establishes a specific pattern for generating responses by iterating over the list and requesting definitions for each term.</p>
<p>By using this prompt engineering technique, you can leverage the OpenAI API to automate the process of creating a dictionary with definitions for various vocabulary terms in computational linguistics.</p>
</details></div>
<div id="fragment-6" style="overflow: auto:;">
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>It's worth noting that prompt engineering requires careful crafting and fine-tuning to achieve desired results. Iterating and refining prompts based on the model's outputs and evaluating their effectiveness is a crucial step in the process.</p>
<p>By continuously improving the prompts and adjusting instructions, you can enhance the model's ability to generate accurate and contextually appropriate responses, ensuring the automation of tasks like dictionary creation is efficient and effective.</p>
